             <h2>Why i started coding and when i knew it was for me.</h2>
             <p>I started this journey just over a year ago now and i have to say its one of the best decisions i ever made. I always loved to be creative, whether it was 3D modelling using blender, making silver jewellery or just finding new ways to do things.
             <br>
             <br>
             When i discovered coding it started from my love of video games and thinking "I wonder if i could make something like this?, Any feature or game mechanic i wanted?! Sign me up!"
             <br>
             <br>
             So naturally i started with C++ and learnt to love it, creating algorithims for basic things like a game of tic-tac-toe or a cash machine thats nice to you if you have loads of money..weird i know but i was having fun learning the process.
             <br>
             <br>
             A lot of video, reading and discoveries later i was left spoilt for choice. "There's how many languages?!" "Wait there's a front AND a back end?" "Hang on you're telling me there's libraries that are NOT full of books?.."
             <br>
             <br>
             And that's when it happened.. i caught the bug, reaslising there was endless possibility to what i could make and create, i just needed to gain the knowledge and i wanted to do it quickly.
             </p>
              <div class="left-accent"></div>

           <div class="right-tab">
              <h2>Gaining the knowledge i needed... maybe?</h2>
              <p>Once i realised i wanted to pursue development as a career i looked for online courses to vary my skills. I did Cisco's C++ associate course and then found out i didnt have the money to pay for the final exam. After, i found FreeCodeCamp and completed their certification in Responsive Web Development that covered HTML5,CSS3 and basic JavaScript.
              <br>
              <br>
              During all of the free online courses i knew they would help me show initiative and interest but i couldn't help but feel like they weren't going to be credible enough to help me get an apprenticeship or entry-level job so i started to look elsewhere.
              <br>
              <br>
              I tried my luck with apprenticeships, "A-level or equivalent in a STEM background OR a level 3 software development diploma". Okay so i used to be a vehicle technician but that doesnt REALLY count and i thought the idea of an apprenticeship was to help me get those qualifications?

             <h2>My background, what i did before and why im here.</h2>
             <p>
             As i mentioned breifly above what i mainly used to do was repair vehicles, i prefer "vehicle technician" over "mechanic" but thats mainly due to the stigma around the title. Anyway, i started at Porsche which sounds fancy i know and it felt it at times when you were trusted with your next job on a $1million+ supercar but the role definetely lacked creative freedom. 
             <br>
             <br>
             A redundancy later and i found a new job across the road *literally* at Ford, same deal, less fancy. A second redundancy and a rather stubborn pandemic later i found myself out of a job with no trust in the motor trade, i needed something reliable, something to keep me going whilst i studied. Thats it, ill get a job in retail, boost my people skills during the day and study in the evenings, retail is booming, always has been.. right?
             <br>
             <br>
             Well, after just over a year.. you guessed it.. redundancy number 3 *no prizes for guessing that one though* the company closed just over 200 stores and i decided to open up to new possibilities sooner rather than later. I had saved just enough money to survive so i made the decision to study full time and go after what i REALLY wanted.
             </p>
              <div class="left-accent"></div>
          </div>
               <div class="right-tab2">
              <h2>Why i think i am suited to the role.</h2>
              <p>Although my past work experience doesn't exactly scream "i'd be a great developer" it has certainly given me skills that would be useful. My time at Porsche gave me the ability to work amazingly in a team whilst also being able to put my head down and get work done solo. At Ford i learnt the importance of following processes when they're needed and undertanding the importance of not being afraid to ask questions, even if they seem silly.
              <br>
              <br>
              Retail certainly taught me alot but what i got from it the most was a major boost to my people skills, a much more professional mindset and a huge appreciation for customer/colleague relationships.
              <br>
              <br>
              The decision to study full-time and use my savings along with the 3 redundancies may seem bad but i wouldnt be here without them. They taught me not to give up, gave me experience in "working from home" and allowed me to find out i enjoy hours spent infront of my PC learning and creating.

                  <h2>What i'm looking for and want to achieve.</h2>
                   <p>
                       Ultimately i am looking for an apprenticeship or entry-level position in either software development or web development.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       I understand my skills and credentials aren't exactly incredible but ive gained considerable knowledge in a short space of time. I am super passionate about surrounding myself with the enviroment and resources i need to constantly improve and level-up my skills.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       A role with training, room for progression and plenty of projects to get stuck into would be ideal. But i am 100% open to other ideas and roles part-time or full-time.
